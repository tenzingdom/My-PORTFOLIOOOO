    ED Project 1
  </caption>
  <p>
   This project was our first big project. We all had difficulty and challenges. However, we all got over it and was able to do a poster presentation. I used fusion 360 and Lazer cutting for the first time in my life. It was very fun. I made a desk elevation extension. It was very useful. <a href="bb.html">ED Photos</a>

    N&A Activity

  <p1>
    We did many activities such as climbing mount Hakusan, camping, and swimming in the river. A river is a large natural stream of water flowing in a channel to the sea, a lake, or another river. Every event was exciting and I wish to continue this in 2023. <a href="cc.html">N&A Photos</a>
